# 📊 HR Attrition Analysis: Employee Retention Strategy Dashboard

A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore employee turnover patterns—focusing on departmental risks, income correlation, work-life balance, and job satisfaction.

## 📝 Short Description / Purpose
The **HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard** is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help HR leaders and organizational strategists understand why employees leave. By analyzing data from 1,470 employees, this tool identifies critical "hot spots" in turnover, such as specific job roles and income brackets, allowing for data-driven intervention and targeted retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
* 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
* 📂 **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the dataset.
* 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures (Attrition Rate, Employee Counts) and dynamic visuals.
* 📝 **Data Modeling** – Established relationships between demographics, satisfaction scores, and financial data.
* 🐍 **Python (Pandas)** – Utilized for initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical validation.

### 4. Behavioral & Satisfaction Heatmaps
Visualizes the correlation between **Overtime** and churn, showing that employees working OT are **3x more likely to leave (31.5%)**. It also maps Job Satisfaction levels against attrition counts.

## 💡 Business Impact & Insights
* **Retention Optimization:** HR can use this dashboard to identify that reducing overtime in the Sales and R&D departments could potentially lower their respective attrition rates by up to 20%.
* **Compensation Strategy:** Management can identify underdeveloped salary bands where turnover is highest to adjust market competitiveness.
* **Strategic Training:** Identifying high-attrition roles (like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Reps) allows for the implementation of better onboarding and career-pathing programs.
